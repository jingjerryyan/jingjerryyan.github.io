This page offers a brief introduction to my name and story. I go by Clara in the U.S., though I was born and raised in Shanghai. Since my teens, I’ve studied in the U.S. as an international student and have found that my Chinese name is often difficult for non-Mandarin speakers to pronounce. This page serves as a guide to it.

My name

# Surname: 徐 (Xú)

- **Pronunciation**: IPA: [ɕy]; "shü" – similar to "sh" in she, with lips rounded as in French u, rising pitch.
- **Original Meaning**: "to proceed tranquilly; a gentle, unhurried pace."
- **Character Components**: 
  - Left: 彳 (step)
  - Right: 余 (phonetic)
- **Classical Citation**: 《前赤壁賦》(蘇軾)：「清風徐來，水波不興。」
  ("A gentle breeze glided with unhurried grace, yet the water slept in perfect stillness." — Su Shi, Former Ode on the Red Cliffs)
- **Later Usage**: denotes "slow, unhurried and measured."

# First Name: 驰 (Chí)

- **Pronunciation**: IPA: [tʂʰʅ]; "chrr" – aspirated "ch" as in cheer, then a brief retroflex "r-hm," with a rising pitch.
- **Original Meaning**: "the powerful gallop or swift motion of a horse."
- **Character Components**: 
  - Left: 馬 (horse)
  - Right: 也 (signifies extension in both directions)
  Together, the character depicts a horse in full stride—head and tail outstretched—conveying the vigour of gallop and the swiftness of acclaim, as in 「馳譽」(widely acclaimed).
- **Classical Citation**: 《楚辭·離騷》(屈原)：「神高馳之遐遊。」
  ("My soul soared and galloped forth into the boundless beyond." — Qu Yuan, The Songs of Chu)
- **Later Usage**: denotes "fast, running, rapid dissemination."
